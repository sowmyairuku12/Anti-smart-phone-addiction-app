                                Abstract
While the popularity of smartphones has given enormous convenience to our lives, their  
pathological use has created a new mental health concern among the community. The key  
differences between smartphones and previous mobile phones are full-featured Internet 
access and easy installation of new applications through modern OS platforms and app 
stores. Hence, smartphones are now considered handheld computers rather than traditional 
phones Behaviour addictions, including smartphone addiction, are often difficult to define 
since they are related not only to physical but also to psychological and social aspects.Anti- 
Smartphone Addiction system will help to use the smartphone by limiting the usage by 
notifying the user that they are on their smartphone for a long. It promotes healthier usage 
patterns by tracking screen time and app usage. The system can block distracting apps after 
reaching a set limit, encouraging users to take mindful breaks. This solution is especially 
useful for students and professionals who struggle with digital distractions. Ultimately, it 
aims to restore balance between digital and real-world interactions.
